 - Connect to the hr.db (stored in supporting-files directory) with sqlite3 
 - Write a query to find the names (first_name, last_name) of the employees who have a manager who works for a department based in the United States. 
 

Expected columns:
    - first_name	
    - last_name	
    - manager_od

Notes:
    - Use tables employees, departments and locations
    - You shouldnâ€™t use JOINs here. 
    - You can connect to DB from Jupyter Lab/Notebook, explore the table and try different queries
    - In the variable 'SQL' store only the final query ready for validation
